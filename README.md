# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

## 📌 Project Topic
This project focuses on **predicting house prices** using **machine learning algorithms** based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, condition, year built, and more.

---

## 🎯 What We Will Do

In this project, we'll:

1. Load and preprocess the **House Price Prediction Dataset**
2. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🕵️‍♂️
3. Clean and encode the data 🧼
4. Train multiple **regression models**
5. Evaluate their performance using **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** 📉
6. Identify the best performing model 🥇

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

📦 The following Python libraries were used:

- **Pandas** → For data loading and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** → For data visualization
- **Seaborn** → For correlation heatmaps and plots
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** → For preprocessing, model building, and evaluation

---

## 🧑‍💻 Languages Used

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any Python IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

## 🧪 Steps Followed

### ✅ Step 1: Importing Libraries & Dataset
- Load the Excel dataset using `pandas`
- Display first few rows and check dataset shape

### ✅ Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Identify columns by data types (categorical, integer, float)
- Count how many of each type we have

### ✅ Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use `seaborn` heatmaps to check correlation
- Use barplots to visualize categorical features and their distributions

### ✅ Step 4: Data Cleaning
- Drop irrelevan
